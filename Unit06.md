**Unit 6: Jean-Paul Sartre** <span id="6"></span> 
*Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) is the public face of existentialism. His
works, both fictional and philosophical, resoundingly affirm the
existentialist priority of concrete, situated, and historical human
existence. He stresses the value of choice, responsibility, and
authenticity in human self-fashioning. Sartre was awarded the Nobel
Prize in Literature in 1964 – an honor he refused because he maintained
that it conflicted with his professional, personal, and political
commitments. This unit will introduce you to Sartre’s contributions to
existentialist philosophy while simultaneously highlighting Sartre’s
place in the movement’s history. In particular, you will explore how
Sartre expanded on existentialist themes dealt with by his predecessors
– for example, the notions of authenticity, anxiety, and freedom.*

    existentialism that Sartre addresses, making a list of each
    criticism and how Sartre counters them. Consider the validity of

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this article.
    While the emphasis on human freedom is one of the cornerstones of
    existentialist thought, Sartre goes a step further and argues that
    we are “radically free.” This is because, as we saw in subunit 6.3
    of this course, Sartre believes that God does not exist. This
    radical freedom, however, is a burden, according to Sartre. As you
    read Harle’s article, consider the manner in which Sartre
    characterizes radical freedom as humanity’s greatest burden.
