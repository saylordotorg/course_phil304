**Unit 1: Blaise Pascal** <span id="1"></span> 
*Since the term* existentialism *was not used to describe a
philosophical movement until the twentieth century, it is anachronistic
to call Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) an existentialist. However, his
concern with the limitations of human existence (or finitude, in
philosophical terms); the presence of constant change, uncertainty, and
suffering in the progress of human life; and the irrationality of human
beings’ actions has persuaded many philosophers that he is, at the very
least, a precursor to the existentialist movement. Pascal was a
mathematical genius whose father counted among his friends the French
rationalist philosopher and “father” of modern philosophy, René
Descartes. In 1654, after a severe bout with depression, Pascal had a
religious experience. He entered a monastery and dedicated the rest of
his life to defending the Christian faith against its critics. Pascal’s
most famous work, written as a defense, or apology, of Christianity that
included meditations on suffering, sin, and faith, was published
posthumously as the* Pensées *(translated as “thoughts”). This unit will
introduce you to Pascal and the Pensées and give you an overview of
Pascal’s “proto-existentialism,” which provided a foundation for
philosophical themes – including contingency (or the uncertainty of
future events), anti-rationalism, and individual existence – with which
many existentialists would grapple a few hundred years later.*

by the lecture assigned beneath sub-subunit 1.3.1.*

**1.4.1 The First Choice of the Wager: To Believe in God and Risk
Heaven** <span id="1.4.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Oregon State University: Bill Uzgalis’ version of
    Pascal’s *Pensées***
    Link: Oregon State University: Bill Uzgalis’ version of Pascal’s
    *[Pensées](http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/pascal/pensees-contents.html) *(HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above to access Pascal’s
    *Pensées*. Then, scroll down and read paragraph 233, in the section
    titled “Section III: The Necessity of the Wager.” As you read,
    attempt to draw a diagram showing your various choices for belief,
    as outlined by Pascal. Because, according to Pascal, the fate of
    your eternal soul rests on your belief or lack of belief in God,
    consider following potential consequences: What if you believe in
    God and God does exist? What if you believe in God and God does not
    exist? By the same token, what if you do not believe in God and God
    does exist? What if you do not believe in God and God does not
    exist? Ultimately, the “wager” that Pascal proposes should make the
    potential consequences of the choice to believe or not to believe
    very clear.

question.*
