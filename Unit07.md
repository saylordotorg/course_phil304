**Unit 7: Simone de Beauvoir** <span id="7"></span> 
*A novelist, social critic, and philosopher, Simone de Beauvoir
(1908–1986) extended Sartre’s existentialism to the realm of the social
and the political, developing an existentialist ethics and a feminist
philosophy that would have a lasting influence on the feminist political
movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Like existentialists before her, de
Beauvoir emphasized the centrality of individual freedom to human
existence. But unlike existentialists before her, she argued that
individual freedom was possible only on the condition that others were
free. In other words, equitable social relations are necessary for a
meaningful freedom, according to de Beauvoir. In this unit, you will
learn about de Beauvoir’s existentialist ethics and her existential
feminism.*
