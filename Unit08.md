**Unit 8: Albert Camus** <span id="8"></span> 
*Albert Camus (1913–1960) was an Algerian writer and intellectual who
refused to be called a philosopher because he did not believe that human
reason was capable of systematizing human experience in all of its
nuances. He was a friend and, later, a critic of Sartre, and his works
manifest concerns similar to those of Sartre. Camus was awarded the
Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957. In this unit, you will explore Camus’
existentialism through an examination of his book* The Stranger *and his
essay “The Myth of Sisyphus” (both published in 1942), which highlight
the absurdities of human existence and, interestingly enough, the
absurdity of existentialism itself if the philosophy is taken to an
extreme. You also will develop an appreciation of the manner in which
Camus represents the synthesis of existentialist thinking since Pascal.*
