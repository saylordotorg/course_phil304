**Unit 3: Fyodor Dostoevsky** <span id="3"></span> 
*Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (1821–1881) was a Russian novelist,
journalist, and essayist whose literary works are foundational texts in
the history of existentialism. Dostoevsky (sometimes spelled*
Dostoyevsky*) explored the loneliness and desperation of the human
condition. He viewed the human condition as constrained by social,
political, and economic institutions and limited by God, whose
existence, Dostoevsky argued, imposes limits on human existence. This
unit will guide you in an exploration of the main existentialist themes
in Dostoevsky’s literary works, paying special attention to the concepts
of human freedom and moral responsibility in* Notes from the
Underground *(1864) and “The Grand Inquisitor” (1880).*
