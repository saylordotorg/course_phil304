**Unit 4: Friedrich Nietzsche** <span id="4"></span> 
*An unapologetic critic of culture, society, religion, and philosophical
dogma (philosophical beliefs that his predecessors and contemporaries
accepted without question), Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) is arguably
one of the most important thinkers of the past two centuries. Like all
existentialists, Nietzsche denounced the universalistic tendencies
displayed throughout the history of Western philosophy; that is, the
tendencies of philosophers to assert that what they knew or believed or
discovered should be considered true for everyone and for all time.
According to Nietzsche, there is no such thing as a universal truth that
is true for everyone and for all time. Instead, Nietzsche argued that
what was true from one person’s perspective might not be true from
another person’s perspective (a philosophical idea known as
perspectivism). For Nietzsche, all human perspectives are valid in the
quest for truth. This emphasis on the significance of individual points
of view underscores Nietzsche’s belief in the priority of individuality,
the value of suspicion and skepticism, and a rejection of rationalism in
the quest for truth. These values are existentialist themes shared by
Nietzsche’s predecessors and successors alike. In this unit, you will
explore Nietzsche’s version of existentialism and analyze his theory of
values and morality*.
