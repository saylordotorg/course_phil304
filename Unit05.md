**Unit 5: Martin Heidegger** <span id="5"></span> 
*Martin Heidegger’s (1889-1976) extensive and illuminating meditations
on what he described as the ontological “question of being” established
his reputation as one of the most original and important philosophers of
the twentieth century. Like other philosophers commonly referred to as
existentialists today, Heidegger refused to associate his own thinking
with the term* existentialism. *However, his focus on human existence,
anxiety, death, and authenticity – themes shared by both his
predecessors (Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, and Nietzsche) and his
contemporaries (Sartre and Camus) – place him at the center of this
movement. In this unit, you will explore Heidegger’s thought, especially
the philosophy of existence that he introduced in his most famous work,*
Being and Time *(1927).*
