**Unit 2: Søren Kierkegaard** <span id="2"></span> 
*Søren Aabye Kierkegaard (1813–1855) was a Danish Christian philosopher,
theologian, and social critic, widely considered a founding figure in
existentialism. Convinced that the Christian faith, as it was generally
practiced, had lost its way, Kierkegaard was a fierce critic of
religious dogma. Kierkegaard believed that a human being’s relationship
with God must be hard-won, a matter of devotion and suffering. According
to Kierkegaard, a person becomes a committed, responsible human being by
making difficult decisions and sacrifices. The force of Kierkegaard’s
philosophy rests in the notion that human life is paradoxical and absurd
and that to confront this absurdity is to become truly human (a theme
that is taken up again by Albert Camus, as discussed in Unit 8 of this
course). This unit will introduce you to Kierkegaard’s life and
religious philosophy, as well as provide you with an overview of themes
in Kierkegaard’s writings that serve as cornerstones for what would be
called existentialism by later philosophers discussed in this course –
particularly Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. These key
existentialist themes include the notions of commitment and
responsibility, absurdity, anxiety, and authenticity. *
